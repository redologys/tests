Q: Do you offer free estimates?
A: Yes, we provide completely free, no-obligation estimates for all projects. Our team will visit your property, assess the work needed, and provide a detailed written quote within 24-48 hours.

Q: What areas do you serve?
A: We serve all five NYC boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) plus nearby areas in New Jersey. Our projects range from small repairs in Jamaica to large commercial build-outs across the city.

Q: Do you handle both residential and commercial work?
A: Absolutely. We specialize in both—from kitchen remodels and bathroom renovations for homeowners to retail build-outs, office renovations, and restaurant construction for businesses.

Q: Are you licensed and insured?
A: Yes, we're fully licensed, bonded, and insured with comprehensive general liability and workers' compensation coverage. We maintain all NYC Department of Buildings requirements and stay current with building codes.

Q: Do you take small jobs?
A: Yes! We welcome projects of all sizes. Whether you need drywall repair, a leaky faucet fixed, or a complete home renovation, we bring the same professional craftsmanship to every job.

Q: How long do projects typically take?
A: It varies by scope: bathroom remodels average 2-3 weeks, kitchens 4-6 weeks, and full renovations 2-4 months. We provide a detailed timeline during the estimate phase with clear milestones from start to finish.

Q: Do you handle permits?
A: Yes, permit applications and inspections are included in our service. Most major renovations (structural changes, electrical, plumbing, HVAC) require NYC permits, and we handle the entire process on your behalf.

Q: What warranties do you offer?
A: We provide a one-year workmanship warranty on all labor and installation, plus we pass through manufacturer warranties on materials and fixtures (typically 5-25 years depending on the product).

Q: What services do you offer?
A: Our services include kitchen and bathroom remodeling, basement finishing, home additions, flooring, drywall, painting, commercial build-outs, office renovations, and complete home or building renovations.

Q: How much do projects cost?
A: Costs vary based on scope and materials. Typical ranges: bathroom remodels $8,000-$25,000, kitchens $15,000-$50,000+, full renovations $50,000-$200,000+. Contact us at (347) 986-4284 for a detailed estimate specific to your project.
